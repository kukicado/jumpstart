# Jumpstart! An Introduction to MongoDB's Most Indispensable Tools for Developers

## Welcome

MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Realm, MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Charts, MongoDB Search?
Are you a new MongoDB developer? Do you want to learn these tools but donâ€™t know
where to start? This hands-on, beginner-friendly workshop is the perfect place
to get your feet wet! We'll build a fun, gif-filled, competition app together
while introducing a wide variety of MongoDB developer tools.

## Pre-requisites

- A MongoDB Atlas account. Get one for free [here](https://mongodb.com/atlas).
- A recent version of Node.js and npm.

## Content

This workshop is split into five modules. The modules are as follows:

- Module 1 - MongoDB Atlas
- Module 2 - MongoDB Compass
- Module 3 - MongoDB Realm
- Module 4 - MongoDB Search
- Module 5 - MongoDB Charts

Each module builds on top of the last one, and by the end you'll have a fully
working web application. I encourage you to watch the workshop and follow along
for additional context. Feel free to do on your own, or follow along with this YouTube video:
